# Privacy Policy

## Overview

Visa Sponsor Checker is a browser extension that checks whether a company on a job listing appears in the UK Home Office sponsor register. This policy explains what data is processed and why.

## Data we process

The extension processes the following limited data:

- **Company name from the active job listing page** (used only to perform a sponsor lookup).
- **Anonymous usage event** (a random client key + lookup status such as “likely”, “not_found”, “unclear”, or “rate_limited”).

We do **not** collect names, emails, passwords, payment details, or health information.

## How we use data

- The company name is sent to our backend to perform a lookup against the sponsor register.
- Anonymous usage events help us monitor reliability and improve the service.

## Data retention

- Sponsor lookup results may be cached locally in the browser for up to 24 hours to reduce requests.
- Anonymous usage events are stored in Supabase for operational monitoring.

## Data sharing

We do not sell or share user data with third parties. Data is only used to provide and improve the extension’s functionality.

## Security

We follow standard security practices to protect data. Secrets are not stored in the extension.

## Your choices

You can uninstall the extension at any time to stop all data processing.
